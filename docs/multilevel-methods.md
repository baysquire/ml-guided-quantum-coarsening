# Multilevel Methods and Graph Coarsening

This note overviews classical multilevel strategies adopted here.

- Heavy-edge matching: greedily contract heavy edges to form aggregates.
- Random matching: random pairings for contraction (baseline).
- AMG-inspired coarsening: leverage algebraic measures to decide aggregates (conceptual placeholder).

The repository provides classical implementations for the first two and a conceptual scaffold for AMG-inspired strategies.
